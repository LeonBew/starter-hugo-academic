abstract: Astronomers have been measuring the separations and position angles between the two components ofbinary stars since William Herschel began his observations in 1781. In 1970, Anton Labeyrie pioneered amethod, speckle interferometry, that overcomes the usual resolution limits induced by atmospheric turbulence by taking hundreds or thousands of short exposures and reducing them in Fourier space. Our 2022 automation of speckle interferometry allowed us to use a fully robotic 1.0-meter PlaneWave Instruments telescope, located at the El Sauce Observatory in the Atacama Desert of Chile, to obtain observations of many known binaries with established orbits. The long-term objective of these observationsis to establish the precision, accuracy, and limitations of this telescope’s automated speckle interferometry measurements. This paper provides an early overview of the Known Binaries Project and provide example results on a small-separation (~0.27ʺ) binary, WDS 12274-2843 B 228.
