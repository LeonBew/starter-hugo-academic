Speckle interferometry targets were observed with the 1.5-meter telescope at Mt. Wilson in a more automated manner compared to previous years. Through use of our custom NINA plugin and two network-connected ASCOM telescopes to transmit telescope information, the observations were conducted without human intervention aside from operator control (and finished slew confirmation).

Several teams of students were instructed in operating the telescope and setting up the automated NINA sequence, and several papers will be written on the large amount of data collected in June.

The observations concluded with a visit of the space shuttle Endeavour and a tour of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, hosted by Dr. Rob Zellem.
