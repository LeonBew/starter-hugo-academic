Observatory Kipshoven is a private facility dedicated to scientific measurements and research, with a specific focus on exoplanet photometry and speckle interferometry.

The telescope at Observatory Kipshoven is a GSO Ritchey-Chr√©tien model. It features a 0.25-meter aperture and offers a balanced combination of field of view and resolution. The telescope has a corrected field, corrected baffling, and autofocusing capability.

The telescope is undermounted on an EQ6-R mount (22kg of 20 kg limit) and thus guided off-axis with using a ZWO ASI174MM.

A QHY268M camera with a IMX268 monochrome CMOS sensor is used for capturing images, replacing an earlier QHY600. 

Observations cover a range of celestial phenomena, including exoplanets, eclipsing binary stars, variable stars, supernovae, orbiting binary stars, and applicable photocenter targets.

Observations are uploaded to a local server and contributed to ExoClock.
