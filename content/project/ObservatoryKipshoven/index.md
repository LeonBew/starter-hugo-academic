**Observatory Kipshoven** is a private observatory dedicated to scientific measurements and research, with a specific focus on photometry and speckle interferometry.

After quite a lot of setup and configuration over the years, the observatory's operation is **autonomous**. I wouldn't have time to operate it while attending university anyways. The dome has a weather sensor installed, so it opens up when the sky is clear, or closes and waits if conditions are poor. 

My interactions with the telescope are typically limited to reading the status messages it sends to my phone.

The telescope at Observatory Kipshoven is a GSO Ritchey-Chr√©tien RC10. It features a 0.25-meter aperture and offers a balance between field of view and resolution. The telescope has a corrected field through corrective lenses mounted inside the of the focuser, corrected internal baffling, and autofocusing capability.

The telescope is undermounted on an EQ6-R mount (22kg of 20 kg limit) and thus guided off-axis with using a ZWO ASI174MM.

A QHY268M camera with a IMX268 monochrome CMOS sensor and 2" filter wheel are used for capturing images, replacing an earlier QHY600. 

Targets include exoplanets, eclipsing binary stars, variable stars, supernovae, orbiting binary stars, and applicable photocenter targets.

Observations are uploaded to a local server, published, shared, or contributed to ExoClock.
